=== App Rundown ===

The app relies on express.js for api endpoints, and relies on a js dictionary
as a "db". The DB structure is as follows :

{
	"ID": {               (ID of metric) (string)
		"NAME": "XXX",      (Name of metric) (string)
		"values": [...],    (Values contained in metric) (numeric)
 		"max": XXX,         (Max val of metric) (numeric)
		"min": XXX,         (Min val of metric) (numeric)
		"sum": XXX,         (Sum val of metric) (numeric)
		"med": {
			"val": XXX,       (Median val of metric) (numeric)
			"isValid": XXX    (Is median value valid?) (boolean)
		}
	} . . .
}

=== Performing HTTP Requests ===

To send requests to the node server I use curl as follows
Here are some example commands :

1) creating metrics (POSTs to /api/metrics)
    A) a metric named "AAPL"

        curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name" : "AAPL"}' localhost:3000/api/metrics

    B) a metric named "AAPL", with initial values of [1,2,3,4]

        curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"name" : "AAPL", "values" : [1,2,3,4]}' localhost:3000/api/metrics

2) viewing the state of the DB (only one way to do this)

    A) curl localhost:3000/api/metrics

3) inserting values into a metric (only one way to do this)

    A) inserting a value of 1 into metric with id == n (assuming a metric at id {n} exists . . .)

      curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"value": 1}' localhost:3000/api/metrics/{n}

4) retrieving summary statistics (only one way to do this)

    A) get summary stats for metric with id == n (assuming a metric at id {n} exists . . .)

      curl localhost:3000/api/metrics/{n}

=== Possible App Questions ===

Q : Why store sum, not mean?
A : We store the sum in order to compute the mean with runtime O(1), since
javascript arrays contain a length property. Just divide sum by length property
and voila. This beats O(n) alternative of storing the mean, which would require
us to recompute the mean each time it is queried.

Q : What is isValid about?
A : The median is the only summary statistic which can't be retrieved in constant
time. As a result, we avoid computing it until the summary statistics for a given
metric are queried. Once that happens, we check to see if the current value is
valid ("isValid" == true). If it isn't, compute it. If it is, simply return
"val". This permits successive calls for the query statistic of a metric to be
constant time, since the median isn't changing. However, once a value is added
to the metric, the median will have shifted. We set isValid to false, and once
a new call for the summary statistic occurs, we recompute it as before, and set
isValid to true.

=== Testing ===

I used mocha + supertest for endpoint testing. As of yet I managed to test the
creation of metrics (suite 1) and the retrieval of the db (suite 2). The
retrieval of summary stats was tested by hand (i know i know), as was the
posting of values to metrics. To run the tests simply go to the app root folder
and run "npm test".

The program passes 25 tests, and has 2 undefined test suites, one for
each part of the app I failed to write unit tests for. The app fails on my json
response test. The app should be returning JSON, but instead returns "text/html;
charset=utf-8". The express endpoints should be returning proper JSON headers
via the res.json() calls, as specified here (https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.json),
but I can't seem to figure out why my tests detect otherwise.
